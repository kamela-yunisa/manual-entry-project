# manual-entry-project
Manual data entry from a PDF file into a structured spreadsheet (CSV format). Includes Name, Title, Company, Address, and contact details, when available on the resource file.

## Project Structure

- [data-raw](/data-raw) → The folder containing the original PDF file
- [data-final](/data-final) → The folder containing the CSV file after manual data entry from the PDF file

## Project Workflow

1. Open the PDF file in /data-raw.
2. Enter the data manually into a spreadsheet.
3. Save the completed spreadsheet as a CSV in /data-final.

## Notes

- The raw data in /data-raw comes from [Azharul Rafy's Data Entry Projects](https://azharulrafy.com/data-entry-projects), used here solely for practice purposes and to help build my portfolio.
